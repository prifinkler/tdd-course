- Test a word is a Palindrome
- Spells the same forwards as backwards
- Example: Madam, Level, Deed, etc.
- Not a Palindrome: Food, Energy, etc.

Step 1 - Devise how you would test this?

Two contexts here:
1) The word is a Palindrome
- it should read the same forwards as backwards

2) The word is NOT a Palindrome
- it should NOT read the same forwards as backwards

- change the case to lower case so we can do an accurate comparison
- find the number of characters in the word
- determine the mid-point, depending on whether the lenght is an even or odd number
- split the word into two substrings, the head and the tail
- reverse the tail (or the head)
- compare the two halves
