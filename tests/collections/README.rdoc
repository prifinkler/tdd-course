Collections! Hash/Array etc...

- Collections are data structures that allows us to have a number of objects grouped in them.
Example: Products, you could have a collection of products as objects in a hash.
Each product can have an id, number, name and other attributes.

We will work with a Product class now and Product will have the following attributes:
id
name
quantity
price

- We return an array of all the products we are creating.
- We do this buy defining a class method 'all' e.g. Product.all

Array of all products:
- array
- class variable: @@products
- add product objects to this @@products class array as they are built in the constructor

Names of all the products from the list of products - Get this list

Ability to filter our data:
- We can replenish our stock when we run out of stock
- We get to know the items that have sold out

Return the total value of the inventory
